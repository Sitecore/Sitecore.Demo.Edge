        <p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Recreational advocates say the metro is in need of another public park, as evidenced by a 40% jump in trail usage last year.</p>
        
        <p>Polk County recently purchased the land &mdash; which is near a flood plain and connects to the Gay Lea Wilson Trail just off East University Ave. &mdash; for $300K.</p>
        
        <p>Lemons to lemonade: While traditional development flunked, the property is ideal for a mountain bike park because its bumpy surface can be used as jumps, Leopold said.</p>
        
        <p>Details: The county&#39;s drafted plans call for 4.5 miles of dirt tracks oriented for mountain biking, fat biking and hiking.</p>
        
        <p>A pump track and skills area would include rocks and other native landscaping features for bikers.</p>
        
        <p>A wetland area would help filter water from Copper Creek before it enters the adjacent Fourmile Creek.</p>
        
        <p>The project is scheduled to be completed in 2025. PLAY! Summit is still looking for partners to assist with maintenance and care after when the park is operational.</p>
